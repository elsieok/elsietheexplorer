This project is an extended version of the interpreter built in Crafting Interpreters (Part II). I implemented a full recursive descent parser and AST-based evaluator in Java, then significantly expanded the language with additional runtime features and usability improvements.

Key enhancements:

 * Ternary conditionals, break and continue, anonymous and static functions, getter methods, and robust REPL improvements

* Custom libraries for arrays, strings, math utilities, file I/O, and core runtime helpers

* Improved syntax with full support for comments, trailing commas, and a transition from print statements to print() functions

* Fully packaged as a self-contained, cross-platform JAR with Unix and Windows launcher scripts for easy execution

* This project deepened my understanding of parsing, runtime evaluation, language design, and cross-platform software packaging in Java.
