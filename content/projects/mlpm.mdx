Despite being one of the most trustworthy password managers around, I couldn't get round to using Apple's native password manager, so I built my own. I used python's cryptography library to write the encrytion logic. After encrption the password is then stored in a SQLite database and access via a GUI implemented with Tkinter.

*This is a personal project, just for fun. While encryption is implemented, this has not been professionally audited. Use at your own risk. For highly sensitive data, consider using professionally audited password managers like Bitwarden or KeePass.*
